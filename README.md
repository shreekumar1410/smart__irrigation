# Smart Irrigation System

The **Smart Irrigation System** is a project designed to automate the irrigation process using environmental data and sensors. It monitors soil moisture levels, temperature, and humidity to efficiently manage water usage and improve crop growth while minimizing water wastage.

## Features

- **Soil Moisture Monitoring**: The system continuously monitors the moisture level of the soil to determine when irrigation is needed.
- **Temperature and Humidity Sensors**: It tracks real-time temperature and humidity levels to adjust irrigation based on environmental conditions.
- **Automated Watering**: Based on sensor data, the system automatically waters plants when needed, optimizing water usage.
- **Manual Control**: Users can manually override the system to control irrigation through a user interface.
- **Data Logging**: Records sensor data for analysis to help improve irrigation strategies over time.

## Tech Stack

- **Microcontroller**: Arduino / Raspberry Pi (whichever you use)
- **Sensors**: Soil moisture sensor, DHT11/22 for temperature and humidity
- **Communication**: Wi-Fi / Bluetooth (depends on your implementation)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for web interface or app control)
- **Backend**: Python / Node.js (for data processing and control logic)
- **Database**: SQLite / Firebase (for logging data)
- **Cloud Platform**: AWS IoT / Google Cloud (optional for remote control)

## Hardware Components

- Soil Moisture Sensor
- Temperature and Humidity Sensor (DHT11/DHT22)
- Water Pump
- Relay Module
- Microcontroller (Arduino / Raspberry Pi)
- Wi-Fi Module (ESP8266 / ESP32)
- Power Supply

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- Arduino IDE / Raspberry Pi setup
- Python / Node.js (for backend processing)
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- A web browser for the control interface

### Steps to Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shreekumar1410/smart__irrigation.git
```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   - If using Python for backend:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   - If using Node.js for backend:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Flash the microcontroller with the Arduino code (if using Arduino):

   - Connect your Arduino to the computer.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and load the `.ino` file.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino.

4. Set up the sensors and actuators according to the wiring diagram (see `/docs/wiring_diagram.png` in the repository).

5. Start the backend server to monitor sensor data and control irrigation:

   - For Python backend:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   - For Node.js backend:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. Open the frontend interface in a browser:

   ```bash
   open http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Usage

Once the system is set up, it will start monitoring soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. The web interface provides real-time data visualization and manual control options for irrigation. The system will automatically irrigate the plants based on sensor input.

You can override automatic control using the web interface and manually trigger irrigation.
